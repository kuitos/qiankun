/**
 * Configuration data needed to create a GitHub Check.
 *
 * GitHub Checks are attached to a particular commit in a particular repo, and
 * are created by GitHub Apps, which are installed into an org or repo.
 *
 * More info at https://developer.github.com/v3/apps/
 *
 * Note that we do not currently manage a generally-accessible GitHub App. We
 * only support a fully self-service integration, whereby users are expected to
 * create their own GitHub App, install it to their repos, grant full power to
 * this binary to act as that App via a private key, and then piggyback on e.g.
 * Travis CI to actually run the benchmarks. This avoids the need to run any
 * services for the time being, but still lets us have our own standalone Check
 * tab in the GitHub UI.
